This is a project I made as part of the Software Developer program at the Manitoba Institute of trades and Technology.

It uses the [mapbox API](https://www.mapbox.com/) and the [Winnipeg Transit API](https://api.winnipegtransit.com/) to allow the user to set an origin (can also use current location), and a destination, and get bus route information & directions to their destination.

The live version can be found on Netlify [here](https://flamboyant-mahavira-e9230e.netlify.app/)
