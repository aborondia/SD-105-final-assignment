This is a project I made as part of the Software Developer program at the Manitoba Institute of trades and Technology.

It it made in JavaScript, and uses the [mapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/) API, and [Winipeg Transit](https://api.winnipegtransit.com/) API, to allow users to search for their destination origin (can also use user location), and destination, and gives them a list of routes (based on current time) they can take to reach it. The user can click on a route to view directions (ride bus, walk, transfer).
